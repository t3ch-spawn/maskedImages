# Masked Image Animation

## About
This project was inspired by an animation I saw on the portfolio site of a web designer (https://www.clayboan.com/work). I found the effect visually striking and decided to replicate it as a way to sharpen my animation and frontend skills.  

## Technologies
I used **React**, **GSAP**, and **TailwindCSS** to build and style the animation.
